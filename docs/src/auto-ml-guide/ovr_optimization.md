# One-vs-Rest (OvR) Optimization in Multi-class Classification

## Overview

When MILO-ML processes multi-class classification problems, it provides two distinct approaches for analyzing individual class performance using One-vs-Rest (OvR) methodology:

1. **Efficient Mode** (Default): Uses the main multi-class model for OvR analysis
2. **Re-optimization Mode** (`reoptimize_ovr=true`): Creates dedicated binary classifiers for each class

## Understanding the Two Approaches

### Efficient Mode (Default)
- **Method**: Uses the existing multi-class model and evaluates each class against all others
- **Speed**: Fast, as it leverages already-trained models
- **Models Created**: Only the main multi-class model
- **Analysis**: Extracts class-specific metrics from the multi-class predictions
- **Use Case**: Quick analysis, resource-constrained environments, initial exploration

### Re-optimization Mode (`reoptimize_ovr=true`)
- **Method**: Creates separate binary classifiers, each optimized specifically for one class vs. all others
- **Speed**: Slower, as it trains additional models for each class
- **Models Created**: Main multi-class model + individual binary OvR models for each class
- **Analysis**: True binary classification metrics for each class-specific problem
- **Use Case**: Maximum accuracy per class, detailed class analysis, production deployment

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Efficient Mode | Re-optimization Mode |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Training Time** | Fast | Slower (trains N additional models) |
| **Model Count** | 1 main model | 1 main + N class-specific models |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower | Higher |
| **Class-Specific Accuracy** | Good | Potentially Better |
| **Hyperparameter Optimization** | Shared across classes | Individual per class |
| **Resource Requirements** | Minimal | Higher |

## When to Use Re-optimization Mode

### Recommended Scenarios:
1. **Class-Specific Performance Critical**: When different classes have very different characteristics requiring specialized optimization
2. **Imbalanced Datasets**: When some classes are severely under-represented and need specialized handling
3. **Production Deployment**: When deploying individual class detectors separately
4. **Performance Maximization**: When seeking the absolute best performance for each class
5. **Clinical/Safety Applications**: Where each class decision has critical implications

### Example Use Cases:
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Each disease type might benefit from specialized detection models
- **Quality Control**: Different defect types might require different feature emphasis
- **Risk Assessment**: Various risk categories might need tailored decision boundaries

## When to Use Efficient Mode

### Recommended Scenarios:
1. **Exploratory Analysis**: Initial model development and feature exploration
2. **Resource Constraints**: Limited computational resources or time
3. **Balanced Datasets**: When classes are well-balanced and similar in nature
4. **Quick Iterations**: Rapid prototyping and model comparison
5. **Sufficient Performance**: When macro-averaged performance meets requirements

## Configuration in MILO-ML

### Enabling Re-optimization Mode
During the training configuration (Step 3: "Train"), you can enable OvR re-optimization:

```
Advanced Options → OvR Re-optimization → Enable
```

### Training Parameters Impact
When re-optimization is enabled:
- **Increased Training Time**: Expect N times longer training (where N = number of classes)
- **Higher Resource Usage**: More memory and CPU requirements
- **Additional Models**: Individual models are saved for each class
- **Enhanced Exports**: Can export class-specific models separately

## Results Interpretation

### Efficient Mode Results
- **Metrics Source**: Derived from multi-class model predictions
- **Consistency**: All classes use the same underlying model architecture
- **Comparison**: Fair comparison across classes using identical methodology

### Re-optimization Mode Results  
- **Metrics Source**: From dedicated binary classifiers
- **Optimization**: Each class gets individually optimized hyperparameters
- **Specialization**: Models can specialize in the unique patterns of each class
- **Performance**: Potentially higher per-class performance

## Performance Comparison Example

Consider a 4-class medical diagnosis problem:

### Efficient Mode Results:
```
Class 0 (Healthy):     ROC AUC = 0.92
Class 1 (Mild):        ROC AUC = 0.85  
Class 2 (Moderate):    ROC AUC = 0.88
Class 3 (Severe):     ROC AUC = 0.94
Macro Average:         ROC AUC = 0.90
```

### Re-optimization Mode Results:
```
Class 0 (Healthy):     ROC AUC = 0.93 (+0.01)
Class 1 (Mild):        ROC AUC = 0.89 (+0.04)
Class 2 (Moderate):    ROC AUC = 0.91 (+0.03)
Class 3 (Severe):     ROC AUC = 0.95 (+0.01)
Macro Average:         ROC AUC = 0.92 (+0.02)
```

## Best Practices

### Start with Efficient Mode
1. **Initial Development**: Begin with efficient mode for rapid iteration
2. **Baseline Performance**: Establish baseline performance across all classes
3. **Identify Problem Classes**: Find classes with poor performance

### Consider Re-optimization When:
1. **Performance Gaps**: Significant performance differences between classes
2. **Critical Applications**: When each class decision has high stakes
3. **Resource Available**: Sufficient computational resources for longer training
4. **Class Specialization**: Evidence that classes need different approaches

### Hybrid Approach
1. **Efficient for Exploration**: Use efficient mode during model development
2. **Re-optimize for Production**: Use re-optimization for final production models
3. **Selective Re-optimization**: Re-optimize only problematic classes if supported

## Monitoring and Evaluation

### Compare Both Approaches
- **Run Both Modes**: Compare results to quantify the benefit
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Weigh performance gains against computational cost
- **Class-Specific Analysis**: Focus on classes where re-optimization helps most

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Per-Class ROC AUC**: Individual class discrimination ability
- **Sensitivity/Specificity**: Class-specific diagnostic accuracy  
- **Precision/Recall**: Relevant for imbalanced classes
- **Training Time**: Resource cost consideration
- **Model Size**: Deployment consideration

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Model Storage
- **Efficient Mode**: Single model file
- **Re-optimization Mode**: Main model + individual OvR models (can be archived)

### Export Options
- **Individual Models**: Export specific class models separately
- **Ensemble Capability**: Combine OvR models for prediction
- **Threshold Tuning**: Individual threshold optimization per class

### Memory Management
- **Automatic Cleanup**: MILO-ML manages memory during re-optimization training
- **Archive Storage**: Completed models are archived to reduce memory usage
- **On-Demand Loading**: Models loaded as needed for prediction/analysis

This feature provides flexibility to balance computational cost against potential performance improvements, allowing users to make informed decisions based on their specific requirements and constraints.
